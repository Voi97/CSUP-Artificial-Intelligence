Project Overview

 As stated previously the idea of the project is to create an AI (Artificial Inteligence) that can recognize if a picture has a dog, cat or panda in it. A user can supply a picture of a dog, cat or panda through the web app of this project and the AI model will recognize and write the name of the animal on the web app. This AI could be used in a lot of other apps, for example apps that track pets so it can recognize what kind of pet it is, or other similar apps.
